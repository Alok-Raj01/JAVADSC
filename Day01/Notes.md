# Day 1 - setup , understanding and output
Hehehahahaha let's start…………….

 **1. Syntax** 

  So syntax is a fix way of writing of code , u can think it's as a Grammer of coding , where will come semicolon and where we hv to write code , where not things like this 

   Now **boilerplate ,** see it's a set of code that is default written in out file or we can say it's a starting point not all languages have boilerplate but java have and what we have in bolderplate in java :

Haha this do not look understandable , now let's see what this means alotught I also don't know …….

So there are two main things one is **class** and another is **function**  and these are the topic we gonna cover later so it's kinda thing yo remeber at first time , but in this a function is written in a class named as **Main** and one more things the Class name and the file name should be match so if file name is [iloveyou.java](http://iloveyou.java) then the funation name should be iloveyou ,hehe and no need to afraid , just enjoy , the fun didt even started yet …

So here's the break down :

**public -** this allows us to use the class or funation use anywhere in code again..

**Class -** this helps to creat an class 

**Stactic and void -**  these are also properties but we relly don't need to know we will be confused then rest remeber these 2 words give functions some properties like void gave that funactuon return no value we will see later….
