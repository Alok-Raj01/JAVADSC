# For loop 
Loops are used to repeat the set of code or a funation and works on a condition,  until your conditions are true then the loop will work and if it's false then the loop stops 

in for loop in decalear an variable inside the statement then set limit and and increment or decrement and all this happens in the argument 
here's the example and syntax 
```java
for(int i = 0;i <=10 ; i++){
   System.out.print(i);
}
// this little program will print counting from 0 to 10
```
> here the loop starts from 0 , loop ends with 10 and everything it repeats it will increase with one 
> herself the flow chart to understand better

> while loop also works on the same way ,the major difference is the syntax and manual update of increasing variable ..

# while loop

this works same but this works on condition , in for loop we give number to make itrations and in while loop whe give condition that means the iterations are not define here , until the condition are true then it will run in loop and as condition false then loop breaks...

```java
int i = 0;
while(condition){
   // code to Run
  i++
}
```

# Do while loop 
this type also takes condition as argumentand it is similar to while loop but one major difference is it do atlest one time run even the condition didn't satisfied 
here the syntax 
```java

do{
   // code to be run in loop
}while(condiation);

```
